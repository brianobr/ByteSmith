## About Me

I'm an AI Software Engineer with over two decades of experience in software development and cloud technologies. Currently specializing in Azure OpenAI, large language models, and intelligent application design, I help businesses leverage AI to solve complex problems.

My journey includes roles at Microsoft as a Developer Support Engineer, where I supported Azure's largest enterprise clients, and as a Senior Software Engineer building healthcare systems. I've also taught over 1,000 students as an Adjunct Faculty member at Dallas College.

Today, I focus on building AI-powered prototypes, chatbots, and virtual assistants using GPT-4, LangChain, and Azure AI services. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between traditional software engineering and modern AI capabilities.
