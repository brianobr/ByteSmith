With the [Azure Login Action](https://github.com/Azure/login), you can login to Azure and run [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/) and [Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/azure) scripts.

Azure Login Action supports different ways of authentication with Azure.

- Login with OpenID Connect (OIDC)
- Login with a Service Principal Secret
- Login with System-assigned Managed Identity
- Login with User-assigned Managed Identity

**We recommend using OIDC based authentication for increased security.**

Warning

By default, the output of Azure CLI commands is printed to the stdout stream. Without redirecting the stdout stream, contents in it will be stored in the build log of the action. Configure Azure CLI to _not_ show output in the console screen or print in the log by setting the environment variable `AZURE_CORE_OUTPUT` to `none`. If you need the output of a specific command, override the default setting using the argument `--output` with your format of choice. For more information on output options with the Azure CLI, see [Format output](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli).

* * *

Warning

Avoid using managed identity login on self-hosted runners in public repositories. Managed identities enable secure authentication with Azure resources and obtain Microsoft Entra ID tokens without the need for explicit credential management. Any user can open pull requests against your repository and access your self-hosted runners without credentials. See more details in [self-hosted runner security](https://docs.github.com/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/about-self-hosted-runners#self-hosted-runner-security).

## Workflow Examples

[Permalink: Workflow Examples](https://github.com/Azure/login#workflow-examples)

### Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC) \[Recommended\]

[Permalink: Login With OpenID Connect (OIDC) [Recommended]](https://github.com/Azure/login#login-with-openid-connect-oidc-recommended)

Note

- Ensure the CLI version is 2.30 or above to support login with OIDC.
- By default, Azure access tokens issued during OIDC based login could have limited validity. Azure access token issued by Service Principal is expected to have an expiration of 1 hour by default. And with Managed Identities, it would be 24 hours. This expiration time is further configurable in Azure. Refer to [access-token lifetime](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/access-tokens#access-token-lifetime) for more details.

Before you use Azure Login Action with OIDC, you need to configure a federated identity credential on a service principal or a managed identity.

- Prepare a service principal for Login with OIDC
  - [Create a service principal and assign a role to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
  - [Configure a federated identity credential on an service principal](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust?pivots=identity-wif-apps-methods-azp#github-actions)
- Prepare a user-assigned managed identity for Login with OIDC
  - [Create a user-assigned managed identity and assign a role to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity)
  - [Configure a federated identity credential on a user-assigned managed identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-create-trust-user-assigned-managed-identity?pivots=identity-wif-mi-methods-azp#github-actions-deploying-azure-resources)

After it, create GitHub Action secrets for following values: (Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).)

- AZURE\_CLIENT\_ID: the service principal client ID or user-assigned managed identity client ID
- AZURE\_SUBSCRIPTION\_ID: the subscription ID
- AZURE\_TENANT\_ID: the tenant ID

Now you can try the workflow to login with OIDC.

Note

In GitHub workflow, you should set `permissions:` with `id-token: write` at workflow level or job level based on whether the OIDC token is allowed be generated for all Jobs or a specific Job.

- **The workflow sample to only run Azure CLI**

```

```

### Login With a Service Principal Secret

[Permalink: Login With a Service Principal Secret](https://github.com/Azure/login#login-with-a-service-principal-secret)

Before you login a service principal secret, you need to prepare a service principal with a secret.

- [Create a service principal and assign a role to it](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal)
- [Create a new service principal client secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-3-create-a-new-client-secret)

After it, create a GitHub Action secret `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` with the value like below: (Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).)

```
{
    "clientSecret":  "******",
    "subscriptionId":  "******",
    "tenantId":  "******",
    "clientId":  "******"
}
```

- clientSecret: the service principal client secret
- subscriptionId: the subscription ID
- tenantId: the tenant ID
- clientId: the service principal client ID

Now you can try the workflow to login with a service principal secret.

- **The workflow sample to only run Azure CLI**

```
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: Run Azure Login With a Service Principal Secret

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: azure/login@v2
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}

    - name: Azure CLI script
      uses: azure/cli@v2
      with:
        azcliversion: latest
        inlineScript: |
          az account show
```

- **The workflow sample to run both Azure CLI and Azure PowerShell**

```
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

on: [push]

name: Run Azure Login With a Service Principal Secret

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

    - uses: azure/login@v2
      with:
        creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
        enable-AzPSSession: true

    - name: Azure CLI script
      uses: azure/cli@v2
      with:
        azcliversion: latest
        inlineScript: |
          az account show

    - name: Azure PowerShell script
      uses: azure/powershell@v2
      with:
        azPSVersion: "latest"
        inlineScript: |
          Get-AzWebApp
```

If you want to pass subscription ID, tenant ID, client ID, and client secret as individual parameters instead of bundling them in a single JSON object to address the [security concerns](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets), below snippet can help with the same.

```
  - uses: azure/login@v2
    with:
      creds: '{"clientId":"${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}","clientSecret":"${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET }}","subscriptionId":"${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}","tenantId":"${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}"}'
```

After it, create GitHub Action secrets for following values: (Refer to [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions).)

- AZURE\_CLIENT\_ID: the user-assigned managed identity client ID
- AZURE\_SUBSCRIPTION\_ID: the subscription ID
- AZURE\_TENANT\_ID: the tenant ID

Now you can try the workflow to login with user-assigned managed identity.

### Login without subscription

[Permalink: Login without subscription](https://github.com/Azure/login#login-without-subscription)

Capability has been added to support access to tenants without subscriptions for both OIDC and non-OIDC. This can be useful to run tenant level commands, such as `az ad`. The action accepts an optional parameter `allow-no-subscriptions` which is `false` by default.

```
# File: .github/workflows/workflow.yml

name: Run Azure Login without subscription

jobs:

  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:

```

### Enable/Disable the cleanup steps

[Permalink: Enable/Disable the cleanup steps](https://github.com/Azure/login#enabledisable-the-cleanup-steps)

In Azure Login Action, "cleanup" means cleaning up the login context. For security reasons, we recommend users run cleanup every time. But in some scenarios, users need flexible control over cleanup.

Referring to [`runs` for JavaScript actions](https://docs.github.com/actions/sharing-automations/creating-actions/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions#runs-for-javascript-actions), there are 3 steps in an action: `pre:`, `main:` and `post:`. Azure Login Action only implement 2 steps: `main:` and `post:`.

There are 2 "cleanup" steps in Azure Login Action:

- cleanup in `main:`
  - It's **disabled** by default.
  - Users can enable it by setting an env variable `AZURE_LOGIN_PRE_CLEANUP` to `true`.
- cleanup in `post:`
  - It's **enabled** by default.
  - Users can disable it by setting an env variable `AZURE_LOGIN_POST_CLEANUP` to `false`.

Azure Login Action use env variables to enable or disable cleanup steps. In GitHub Actions, there are three valid scopes for env variables.

- [env](https://docs.github.com/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#env)
  - valid for all jobs in this workflow.
- [jobs.<job\_id>.env](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idenv)
  - valid for all the steps in the job.
- [jobs.<job\_id>.steps\[\*\].env](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstepsenv)
  - only valid for the step in a job.

We set `jobs.<job_id>.steps[*].env` for example. Users can set `env` or `jobs.<job_id>.env` for a wider scope.

## Security hardening

[Permalink: Security hardening](https://github.com/Azure/login#security-hardening)

Warning

When using self hosted runners it is possible to have multiple runners on a single VM. Currently if your runners share a single user on the VM each runner will share the same credentials. That means in detail that each runner is able to change the permissions of another run. As a workaround we propose to use one single VM user per runner. If you start the runner as a service, do not forget to add the [optional user argument](https://docs.github.com/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service#installing-the-service)

## Azure CLI dependency

[Permalink: Azure CLI dependency](https://github.com/Azure/login#azure-cli-dependency)

Internally in this action, we use azure CLI and execute `az login` with the credentials provided through secrets. In order to validate the new azure CLI releases for this action, [canary test workflow](https://github.com/Azure/login/blob/master/.github/workflows/azure-login-canary.yml) is written which will execute the action on [azure CLI's edge build](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli#edge-builds) which will fail incase of any breaking change is being introduced in the new upcoming release. The test results can be posted on a slack or teams channel using the corresponding integrations. Incase of a failure, the concern will be raised to [azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli) for taking a necessary action and also the latest CLI installation will be postponed in [Runner VMs](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) as well for hosted runner to prevent the workflows failing due to the new CLI changes.
